<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to version 2.7 of the GLFW OpenGL framework. GLFW is a free, open
source, portable framework for OpenGL application development. In short, it is
a library that constitutes a powerful API for handling operating system
specific tasks, such as opening an OpenGL window, reading keyboard and mouse
input, creating threads, and much more.</p>

<p>This is expected to be the last major release of the 2.x series and most
development will take place in the 3.0 branch from now on.  Requests for
additional features in the 2.x branch will be denied.</p>

<p>The only major feature added in this release is support for OpenGL 3.0 and
above.  Note that as Mac OS X does not yet support OpenGL 3.0, attempts to
create such a context on that system will fail.</p>

<h2>2. Compiling GLFW and the example programs</h2>

<p>A top level makefile can be found in the root directory of the GLFW
distribution that has been designed to work with several compilers. If you
simply enter the GLFW root directory in a shell and type <b>make</b> (or
<b>nmake</b> or <b>gmake</b>, depending on the name of your make tool), and a
list should appear with the currently supported options for systems and
compilers.</p>

<p>For example, one of the options is to compile GLFW for Windows with the
LCC-Win32 C compiler. To do that, type <b>make win32-lcc</b> in the shell (as
specified in the previously mentioned list). That will compile the GLFW static
link library and the supplied example programs. For Windows compilers, a Win32
DLL will also be compiled.</p>

<p>Currently supported compilers and systems are:

<ol>
  <li>Borland C++ Builder compiler 5.x for Windows</li>
  <li>Cygwin (GCC) for Windows</li>
  <li>LCC-Win32 for Windows</li>
  <li>MinGW with MSYS for Windows</li>
  <li>OpenWatcom for Windows</li>
  <li>Unix or Unix-like systems running the X Window System (auto detect
      compiler, or force GCC)</li>
  <li>Apple GCC on Mac OS X</li>
</ol>

<p>There are also project files available for Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 in the
<b>support/msvc90</b> directory.</p>

<p>If your compiler/system is not in the list, you may have to create new
makefiles in the <b>lib\win32</b>, <b>lib/x11</b> or <b>lib/cocoa</b>
directory, and in the <b>examples</b> directory. If you have any problems,
please use our support forum and bug tracker on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/glfw/">SourceForge.net</a>. We would
like to support as many systems as possible, so if you had to make any
modifications or additions to the source and/or makefiles in order to make GLFW
compile successfully, we would very much like to know what you had to do.</p>


<h3>2.1 Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 and above</h3>

<p>Project files for both the static and dynamic versions of the GLFW library
are provided in the <b>support/msvc90</b> directory, as well as project files
for all example and test programs.</p>


<h3>2.2 MinGW/MSYS on Windows</h3>

<p>Use the MSYS shell and make for compiling GLFW.</p>

<p>Under Windows 98, the MinGW make program may set the $(MAKE) variable
incorrectly. To remedy this, uncomment the line at the beginning of the top
level Makefile that says MAKE = make (possibly replacing make with some other
name, e.g. mingw32-make).</p>


<h3>2.3 Cygwin on Windows</h3>

<p>The Cygwin makefile was designed to run from a Cygwin bash shell.  You
<em>cannot</em> use an MS-DOS prompt (or NT cmd prompt) to compile GLFW with the
win32-cygwin option. Similarly, the win32-clean option will not work from a
Cygwin shell, which is why there is a special cygwin-clean option.</p>


<h3>2.4 OpenWatcom on Windows</h3>

<p>In order to compile GLFW successfully with OpenWatcom (for Windows),
execute "nmake MAKE=nmake win32-ow" in the GLFW root directory. Also make
sure that you have all your environment variables set up correctly. It is
the default option when installing OpenWatcom to permanently set up all
the required environment variables. If nmake does not work, you probably
have to run "WATCOM\setvars.bat" from the command prompt before executing
nmake, where WATCOM is the directory in which you installed OpenWatcom
(e.g. C:\Watcom).</p>


<h3>2.5 X11 on Unix-like systems</h3>

<p>Compiler and link library capabilities are auto-detected with a script
called <b>compile.sh</b>.  It has been tested under Ubuntu Linux, Slackware
Linux, Debian GNU/Linux and others, but should hopefully run on the majority of
available Unix-like systems and generate functional Makefiles.  You do not have
to run the script manually, since it is called from the top level Makefile.</p>

<p>If you are making your own build setup for GLFW, you need to be aware of the
various preprocessor symbols that the bundled makefiles use to enable various
features and code paths.  They need to be defined either on the command line or
at the very beginning for each GLFW source file with an <code>x11_</code>
prefix.</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>_GLFW_USE_LINUX_JOYSTICKS</td>
    <td>Use the Linux joystick API. This is the only supported API for the X11
        port. Without it, joystick input will be unavailable.</td>

        entry point addresses.  This is a fallback method.</td>

  </tr>

<h3>2.6 Apple GCC on Mac OS X</h3>

<p>To compile GLFW for Mac OS X, you will need to have installed the Developer
Tools.  A version of these tools can be found on your Mac OS X disc, with newer
versions available from the Apple Developer Connection site.  When they are
installed, simply open Terminal and go to the root GLFW directory.  From there,
you can build the library and all the examples by running make with the
appropriate target, i.e. <b>make cocoa</b>.</p>

<h2>3. Installing GLFW</h2>

<h3>3.1 Windows</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW with MinGW or Cygwin, three files of interest should
have appeared in the <b>lib\win32</b> directory. They are: <b>libglfw.a</b>
(the static link version of GLFW), <b>glfw.dll</b> (the DLL version of GLFW)
and <b>libglfwdll.a</b> (the DLL import library).</p>

<p>To install GLFW on Cygwin (and possibly MinGW), run make with the
<b>cygwin-install</b> target.  This will generate the pkgconfig file and copy
it, the header file and the library to the correct locations of your Cygwin
installation. If you wish to change the installation location from its default,
set the desired prefix path with the environment variable <b>PREFIX</b>.</p>

<p>If you used Borland C++ Builder, LCC-Win32, Microsoft Visual C++ or
OpenWatcom, the files are named <b>glfw.lib</b> (the static link version of
GLFW), <b>glfw.dll</b> (the DLL version of GLFW) and <b>glfwdll.lib</b> (the
DLL import library).</p>

<p>The static link library and the DLL import library should be copied to your
compiler's <b>LIB</b> directory (where all other link libraries are located).
The DLL can be copied either to your Windows system directory (where
opengl32.dll is located), or to the project directory of your GLFW-based
projects (where you place your compiled EXEs).</p>

<p>You should also copy the GLFW include file, <b>include\GL\glfw.h</b>, to the
<b>GL</b> directory of your compiler's include directory (where gl.h, glu.h
etc. are located).</p>


<h3>3.2 Unix</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, three files named <b>libglfw.pc.in</b>,
<b>libglfw.a</b> and <b>libglfw.so</b> should have appeared in the
<b>lib/x11</b> directory. This is the pkgconfig template file, the GLFW static
link library and the GLFW shared library, respectively.</p>

<p>To install GLFW onto your system, run make as root with the
<b>x11-install</b> make target. This will install the pkgconfig file, the
static library and the header. By default, the files will be installed under
<b>/usr/local</b>. If you wish to install to a different location, set the
environment variable <b>PREFIX</b> appropriately when running make.</p>

<p>Note that the shared library is not installed by default, as you really
should think twice before using it. GLFW is very small and shared library
distribution on Unix outside of packaging systems is quite tricky. The GLFW
license also allows static linking without requiring your to share your
code.</p>

<p>However, if you're a *nix distribution packager, use a language binding or
for some other reason wish to install the shared library along with the rest,
use the <b>x11-distro-install</b> make target.</p>


<h3>3.4 Mac OS X</h3>

<p>After compiling GLFW, three files named <b>libglfw.pc.in</b>,
<b>libglfw.a</b> and <b>libglfw.dylib</b> should appear in the
<b>lib/cocoa</b> directory. This is the pkgconfig template file, the GLFW
static link library and the GLFW dynamic library, respectively.</p>

<p>To install GLFW onto your system, run make with sudo and the
<b>cocoa-install</b> build target, i.e.:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>sudo make cocoa-install</b>

<p>This will install the pkgconfig file, the
static library and the header. By default, the files will be installed under
<b>/usr/local</b>. If you wish to install to a different location, set
the environment variable <b>PREFIX</b> appropriately when running make.</p>

<p>Note that the shared library is not installed by default, as you really
should think twice before using it. GLFW is very small and very sutable for
static linking. The GLFW license also allows static linking without requiring
your to share your code.</p>

<h2>4. Using GLFW</h2>

<p>There are two aspects to using GLFW:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>How does the GLFW API work</li>
  <li>How to compile programs that use GLFW</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is covered in the <a href="docs/UsersGuide.pdf">GLFW
Users Guide</a> and the <a href="docs/Reference.pdf">GLFW Reference
Manual</a>, and we suggest that you read at least the Users Guide, since
it's a good introduction to the GLFW API.</p>

<p>Designing and compiling programs that use GLFW is not very difficult.
A few rules for successfully designing GLFW-based programs are presented
in the following sections.</p>

<h3>4.1 Include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;</h3>

<p>In your program, you should include &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;. This include
file defines all the necessary constants, types and prototypes that are
used to interact with the GLFW API. It also includes &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; and
&lt;GL/glu.h&gt;, and - <u>this is very important</u> - <i><b>it defines
all the necessary constants and types that are necessary for OpenGL to
work on different platforms</b></i>.</p>

<p>For instance, under Windows you are normally required to include
&lt;windows.h&gt; before you include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;. If you write such a
program, it would not compile under e.g. Linux since &lt;windows.h&gt;
does not exist under Linux. &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt; takes care of these things
for you. Note however that it does not actually include &lt;windows.h&gt;,
it merely mimics the parts of it that are needed for &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; and
&lt;GL/glu.h&gt; (this way we do not get the thousands of constants,
types and prototypes that could otherwise possibly interfere with our own
declarations).</p>

<p>In other words:
<ul>
  <li>Do <i>not</i> include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; or &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;! (GLFW
      does it for you)</li>
  <li>Do <i>not</i> include &lt;windows.h&gt;! (unless you really need
      it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you <i>do</i> need to include &lt;windows.h&gt;, do it
<i>before</i> including &lt;GL/glfw.h&gt;.</p>


<h3>4.2 Link with the right libraries</h3>

<h4>4.2.1 Windows static library</h4>

<p>If you link with the static version of GLFW, it is also necessary to
link with some system libraries that GLFW uses.</p>

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the static version of
GLFW, you must also link with the following libraries: <b>opengl32</b>,
<b>user32</b> and <b>kernel32</b>. Some of these libraries may be linked
with by default by your compiler. In the table below you can see the
minimum required link options for each supported Windows compiler (you may
want to add other libraries as well, such as <b>glu32</b>):</p>

<p><table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Compiler</b></td><td><b>Link options</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Borland C++ Builder</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cygwin</td><td><i>See Unix static library below</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>LCC-Win32</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft Visual C++</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>MinGW32</td><td>-lglfw -lopengl32</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenWatcom</td><td>glfw.lib opengl32.lib user32.lib</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>4.2.2 Windows DLL</h4>

<p>To compile a program that uses the DLL version of GLFW, you need to
define the <b>GLFW_DLL</b> constant. This can either be done with a
compiler switch, typically by adding <b>-DGLFW_DLL</b> to the list of
compiler options. You can also do it by adding the line:</p>

<p>#define GLFW_DLL

<p>...to all your source files that include <b>glfw.h</b>, <u>before</u>
including it.</p>

<p>When linking a program under Windows that uses the DLL version of GLFW,
the only library you need to link with for GLFW to work is <b>glfwdll</b>.
In the table below you can see the minimum required link options for each
supported Windows compiler (you may want to add other libraries as well,
such as <b>opengl32</b> and <b>glu32</b>):</p>

<p><table border=1>
<tr><td><b>Compiler</b></td><td><b>Link options</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Borland C++ Builder</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cygwin</td><td>-lglfwdll</td></tr>
<tr><td>LCC-Win32</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft Visual C++</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
<tr><td>MinGW32</td><td>-lglfwdll</td></tr>
<tr><td>OpenWatcom</td><td>glfwdll.lib</td></tr>
</table>



<h4>4.2.3 Unix static library</h4>

<p>GLFW now supports
<a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/">pkgconfig</a>,
and a libglfw.pc file is generated and installed when you install the library.
For systems that do not provide pkgconfig, you should look in this file for the
proper compile and link flags for your system, as determined by compile.sh at
compile time.</p>

<p>A typical compile and link command line may look like this (using GCC):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>gcc `pkg-config --cflags libglfw` -o myprog myprog.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw`</b>

<p>If you use GLU functions in your program you should also add
<b>-lGLU</b>.</p>



<h4>4.2.5 Mac OS X static library</h4>

<p>When compiling and linking a program under Mac OS X that uses GLFW, you
must also link with <b>Cocoa.framework</b> and <b>OpenGL.framework</b>.

<p>If you are using Xcode, you simply add the GLFW library <b>libglfw.a</b> and
these frameworks to your project. If, however, you are building your program
from the command line, there are two methods for correctly linking your GLFW
program.</p>

<p>GLFW now supports <a
href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/">pkgconfig</a>, and a libglfw.pc
file is generated and installed when you install the library. You can find
pkgconfig in most packaging systems, such as <a
href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> and <a
href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a>, so if you have one
of them installed, simply install pkgconfig. Once you have pkgconfig available,
the command line for compiling and linking your program is:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>gcc `pkg-config --cflags libglfw` -o myprog myprog.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw`</b>

<p>If you do not wish to use pkgconfig, you will need to add the required
frameworks and libraries to your command line using the <b>-l</b> and
<b>-framework</b> switches, i.e.:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>gcc -o myprog myprog.c -lglfw -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL</b>

<p>Note that you do not add the .framework extension to a framework when adding
it from the command line.</p>

<p>These frameworks contain all GL and GLU functions, so there is no need to
add additional libraries or frameworks when using GLU functionality. Also note
that even though your machine may have Unix-style GL libraries, they are for
use with the X Window System, and will <i>not</i> work with the Mac OS X native
version of GLFW.</p>

<h3>v2.4.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Preliminary native Mac OS X support (via the Carbon interface)</li>
 <li>Preliminary DOS support (DJGPP + Mesa)</li>
 <li>Changed license to the zlib license (almost identical to the previous
     GLFW license), so now GLFW is OSI Certified</li>
 <li>Rewrote the GLFW documentation in LaTeX, meaning several improvements
     (both visual and practical)</li>

     support for various languages</li>
 <li>[Win32] Added OpenWatcom compiler support (thanks Sebastian
     Schuberth!)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Changed fallback timer from GetTickCount to timeGetTime,
     which usually provides better resolution</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Accumulator buffer selection should be more
     robust</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: If stereo rendering is requested, and no stereo pixel
     format could be created, glfwOpenWindow now fails</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwSetWindowSize now sets the size of the client
     area, NOT the entire window, meaning that there is a 1:1 relationship
     between glfwSetWindowSize and glfwGetWindowSize</li>
 <li>[X11] Added FreeBSD and QNX support</li>
 <li>[X11] Added support for non-pthread capable systems</li>

</ul>

<h3>v2.4.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added AmigaOS support (preliminary)</li>
 <li>GLFW for the X Window System now works under Mac OS X</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwWaitCond treated the timeout as milliseconds
     instead of seconds</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile under IRIX v5.3</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile with Kylix</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.4</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Major source code rearrangement - much code is now shared between
     different platforms, and it should be easier to port GLFW to new
     platforms</li>
 <li>Added a Unicode keyboard text input interface (CharCallback)</li>
 <li>Keyboard key input is now slightly more internationalized: GLFW now
     uses 8-bit ISO-8859-1 encoding for keys representing printable
     characters (e.g. &quot;&Ouml;&quot;, &quot;&#167;&quot;, etc), as
     opposed to the previous 7-bit US-ASCII encoding</li>
 <li>Added more key constants (F13-F25, keypad '=')</li>
 <li>Added an enable/disable swicth for automatic event polling from
     glfwSwapBuffers</li>
 <li>[X11] Added support for sysctl for querying the number of processors
     in the system (if POSIX sysconf is not supported)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: compile.sh now works with Sun sh (and hopefully others
     too)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: compile.sh now detects the need for -ldl when dlopen is
     used</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: When closing a fullscreen window under Win 9x/NT4,
     the task bar icon now disappears properly</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: GLFW should now compile on a wider range of MSVC
     compilers (e.g. .NET) - Thanks Tim Little!</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.3.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Removed the silly limitation of 100 threads (the thread information
     is now kept in a linked list)</li>
 <li>General source cleanup (window state is now kept in a single
     struct, plus some other minor changes)</li>
 <li>[X11] Added Solaris gethrtime() support (not tested yet), which
     should give an improved timer for Sun/Solaris stations</li>
 <li>[X11] Some fixes to the 'compile.sh' script (-O for non-gcc compilers
     and 'make x11-gcc' should now really force GCC)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.3.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] A minimalist configuration script was added that solves the
     issue with glXGetProcAddressARB, and unifies all Unix/X11 Makefiles
     into one template Makefile (well, one for GLFW, and one for the
     examples)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added OpenGL stereo rendering support</li>
 <li>Added a function for parsing the OpenGL version string
     (glfwGetGLVersion)</li>
 <li>[x86] Bugfix: Hopefully the CPU core clock dependent timer RDTSC will
     never be used on CPUs with variable core frequencies anymore</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW could create stereo rendering capable windows,
     even if it was not requested (GLFW v2.2.x did not support selection
     of stereo rendering)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetProcAddress returned NULL on most systems (even
     on those that supported glXGetProcAddressARB). Now GLFW assumes that
     glXGetProcAddressARB is supported on all systems, which solves the
     bug, but may result in compiler errors on some systems (please let me
     know if you have any related problems).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Bugfix: Checking for GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap is more robust</li>
 <li>Bugfix: glfwLoadTexture2D will now fail if no window is opened</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Right shift was not detected under Win 9x/ME (it is
     still not as good as under NT/2K/XP, but at least you get right
     shifts)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Visuals are now selected more accurately. For instance,
     glfwOpenWindow will no longer fail if you request a 24-bit color
     buffer if only 16-bit color visuals are avilable (which means that
     pong3d should work on 16-bit displays).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Windows did not always get focus (this was a tough
     one!)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwGetWindowParam did not work with
     GLFW_ACCUM_*_BITS or GLFW_AUX_BUFFERS</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Linux joystick Y axis positions were reversed</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[X11] Added joystick support for Linux</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added joystick support (only supported under Windows so far)</li>
 <li>Added joystick controls to pong3d.c (only 3 more lines of code)</li>
 <li>Added glfwOpenWindowHint() function</li>
 <li>It is now possible to specify a desired vertical monitor refresh
     rate (for fullscreen windows)</li>
 <li>It is now possible to request an accumulator buffer and auxiliary
     buffers</li>
 <li>Added glfwSetTime() function</li>
 <li>Added a GLFW conversion of the MESA/GLUT gears.c demo to the example
     programs</li>
 <li>[Win32] gdi32.dll and winmm.dll are now loaded dynamically when
     glfwInit() is called. This means that there is no need to link with
     gdi32.lib or winmm.lib when using the static version of GLFW, which
     should make GLFW usage more convenient.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Greatly improved keyboard input (detect left/right
     CTRL etc)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: glfwExtensionSupported now detects all WGL extensions
     (e.g. WGL_ARB_pbuffer)</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse cursor was not re-hidden when a GLFW window was
     deselected and then selected again (with ALT+TAB)</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Minor bug in the SGI timer - and ugly (unintended) SGI
     timer debug info removed</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetDesktopMode and glfwGetVideoModes no longer give
     segmentation faults if no X server is available</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added image and texture loading capabilities (support for the TGA
     file format at the moment)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program (mipmaps.c) for showing off the automatic
     mipmap generation and texture loading capabilities of GLFW 2.1</li>
 <li>Removed the separate TGA loader (tga.c in the examples directory)
     since texture loading is supported natively by GLFW. Also updated the
     Pong3D demo to use GLFW texture loading instead of tga.c.</li>
 <li>Improved keyboard handling (e.g. numeric keypad keys can be
     detected)</li>
 <li>Added a new example program, keytest.c</li>
 <li>Changed the GLFWvidmode structure and the corresponding API functions
     to report pure color bits instead of the confusing (and unportable)
     "BPP" field</li>
 <li>Changed glfwSetWindowSize so that it operates in fullscreen mode
     too</li>
 <li>Added mouse wheel support under Windows (not Win95) and X11</li>
 <li>Added window iconification functions (glfwInconifyWindow and
     glfwRestoreWindow)</li>
 <li>Improved iconification and deactivation handling under both Windows
     and X11</li>
 <li>Made it possible to turn on/off key repeat (the default is now no key
     repeat)</li>
 <li>Added SGI hardware timer support (CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE) for improved
     timer resolution for SGI computers</li>
 <li>Added support for the free Borland C++ Builder 5.x compiler for
     Windows</li>
 <li>Made it possible to compiler GLFW as a Windows DLL using any of the
     supported compilers</li>
 <li>Some constants have changed names (e.g. GLFW_REDBITS is now called
     GLFW_RED_BITS)</li>
 <li>Updated GLFW documentation (GLFW Users Guide and GLFW Reference
     Manual) to reflect the changes in the API</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Corrected Cygwin toplevel makefile entry</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed event lag bug</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Fixed Radeon 8500 crash</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Fixed the window close bug</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Iconification/deactivation is now detected</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Non-OpenGL visuals are not listed anymore</li>
 <li>[XFree86] Bugfix: Undesired video mode changes are now prevented</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0.3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added precise CPU cycle based timing support (RDTSC) for x86
     CPUs (under both Windows and Unix)</li>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for Windows with Cygwin</li>
 <li>Corrected the CC for Unix/X11 makefiles (-Wall is usually not a
     supported flag for CC, so it was removed from the CFLAGS list)</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added a makefile option for building for X11 with 'cc' rather than
     'gcc' (useful for IRIX users for instance).</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Mouse coordinates are now relative to the window
     upper left corner, which also means that disabling the mouse cursor
     in windowed mode should work much better.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: Added a bunch of more keys that are recognized by
     GLFW.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: glfwGetNumberOfProcessors now works for IRIX (earlier
     versions of GLFW would not compile under IRIX).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
 <li>glfwTerminate() will now be called automatically upon normal program
     termination (using atexit())</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Buffer-swapping did not work if a window lost
     focus.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: Top level Makefile did not work under Windows
     9x.</li>
 <li>[Win32] Bugfix: NULL declaratoin in glfw.h was not MSVC 7.x
     compatible.</li>
 <li>[X11] Bugfix: GLFW would not build with C++ (e.g. g++).</li>
</ul>

<h3>v2.0</h3>
<ul>
 <li>GLFW is no longer a single source file, but an entire link library.</li>
 <li>Added multi threading support.</li>
